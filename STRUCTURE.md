# Clawboss Workspace Structure

This repository follows the "Hybrid Org Chart" pattern from the OpenClaw guide:

- **Marketing boss** delegates to Copywriter + Ad Analyst
- **Operations boss** delegates to Inventory Manager + Supplier Scout
- **Customer Experience boss** delegates to Support Agent + Reviews Manager

Each agent has its own workspace folder (SOUL, USER, AGENTS, IDENTITY, TOOLS, memory/ placeholder). Fill in each agent's SOUL.md yourself.

Open `openclaw.json` for the matching config skeleton (bindings/tokens left as TODO).
